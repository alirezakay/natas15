# NATAS LEVEL 15 WITH NODE.JS 

> http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php

If you are wondering how to solve this level of natas ethical-hacking-games, with Javascript (actually NodeJS), just checkout this branch.

This source-code is not the most optimum way of checking;

The natas passwords are made of characters in range /[0-9A-Za-z]/ \
So you can change the code in a way that it checks only for the characters mentioned earlier.

*Happy Hacking* ðŸ¤—
